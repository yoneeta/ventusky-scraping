# ventusky-scraping
This repo just show the data set from ventusky weather forecast web and use for rainfall analysis using GIS tools Qgis 


it contains a json file which have the row data in order to work with GIS tools we need to convert to csv you can use any tool to convert after conversion you need to give ID for all the rows
the rain fall value is put as mm it attached the image pixel value with exact mm value
according to work on GIS georeferencing is required after referencing pixle to polygon function need to run and assigne id to the pixle polygon then the join relation maintain between
csv and polygon then it works fine.
